		// matter what version of Vash is currently in use.  This allows 
		// users of our library to upgrade Vash (e.g. for performance and API 
		// improvements) without changing the images they produce, potentially
		// confusing their users or breaking security invariants.
		// Currently the only known algorithms are "1" and "1-fast".
		//
		// "1-fast" is modestly faster on large data sets, but is less secure:
		// it uses md5 instead of sha-512 internally.  In general you should use
		// "1", unless you have specific performance concerns with huge data sets.
